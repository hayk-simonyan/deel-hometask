## Requirements

- Node.js >= 10.16.3

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Seed the local SQLite database with the following command:

   ```
   npm run seed
   ```

## Running the Application

Start the server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

`npm start` is used for deployment, for development it's better to run with the dev command.

The server will be running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

Users are authenticated by passing `profile_id` in the request header. After a user is authenticated his profile will be available under `req.profile`.

All the protected routes can be accessed if the correct `profile_id` is set in the request headers.

### Contracts

- **GET** `/contracts/:id`: Fetch a specific contract by ID. (protected)
- **GET** `/contracts`: Fetch all non-terminated contracts for the authenticated profile. (protected)

### Jobs

- **GET** `/jobs/unpaid`: Fetch all unpaid jobs for the authenticated profile. (protected)
- **POST** `/jobs/:id/pay`: Pay for a specific job by ID. (protected)

### Balances

- **POST** `/balances/deposit/:userId`: Deposit money into a client's balance. Should include the amount in `req.body.amount`

### Admin

- **GET** `/admin/best-profession?start=<Date>&&end=<Date>`: Return the best profession within a specified date range.
- **GET** `/admin/best-clients?start=<Date>&&end=<Date>`: Return the best clients within a specified date range.

  Additionally you can use `limit` query to limit the results (by default limit is set to 2).

## Testing

There are couple of unit and integration tests in the `src/controllers` folder. Due to time constraints, I couldn't implement more tests for middlewares, services, and utility functions. In a real-world application, tests wouldn't use or modify the real database but instead would use mock data.

Run the tests with the following command:

```
npm test
```

## Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Applied rate limiting in the endpoint levels to prevent abuse of the API.
- **Validation**: Ensures that only valid data is processed.
- **Secure Headers**: Implemented using Helmet to set various HTTP headers.
- **Improvements**: Further security measures could include adding authentication tokens, implementing HTTPS, and setting up proper CORS policies for specific origins.

## Dependencies

- `body-parser`: Parse incoming request bodies.
- `cors`: Enable CORS with various options.
- `express-rate-limit`: Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express.
- `express-validator`: Express middleware for validating requests.
- `helmet`: Secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
- `sequelize`: Promise-based Node.js ORM for SQL databases.
- `sqlite3`: SQLite client for Node.js.

## Development Dependencies

- `jest`: JavaScript Testing Framework.
- `node-mocks-http`: Mock 'http' objects for testing Express.
- `nodemon`: Automatically restart the application when file changes are detected.
- `supertest`: HTTP assertions library for testing.
